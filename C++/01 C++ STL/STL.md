# 🚀 Introduction to C++ STL

C++ is one of the most popular high-level programming languages 🌐 which is used extensively by developers for a long time and has always been loved ❤️ by all programmers — especially competitive programmers — because of its faster execution time ⚡.

**STL** is one of the unique abilities of C++ that makes it stand out 🌟 from every other programming language. STL stands for **Standard Template Library**, which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers 📦 and classes 📘. This makes it very easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures 🏗️ without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities ⏱️💾.

If you dive a little deeper 🔍 into STL, you will have to understand everything about **templates** and how they work — one of the most powerful tools 🛠️ in C++ programming.

However, in this tutorial, we will stick to some of the most popular STL containers and algorithms 🧮, and their useful functions which are frequently used by programmers 👨‍💻👩‍💻 in day-to-day coding.
